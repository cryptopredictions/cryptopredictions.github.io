<p>The CryptoPredictions application runs on the Ethereum network and utilizes smart contracts (with each being known as a "Smart Contract") to allow users to make predictions. Throughout these Terms of Service, the Smart Contracts and the Site hosting the game will be known as the "Game".</p>

<p>Read the following Terms of Service carefully and thoroughly prior to using the Game, purchasing Smart Contracts, or using the Site. Unless we have a separate, written agreement with you that differs from the below Terms of Service, the following Terms of Service absolutely and unequivocally govern your use of the Game. We will only allow you to use this Game if you accept all of these Terms of Service. By using this Game, you confirm that you understand these Terms and accept these Terms. In the event that you are using this Game, on behalf of another company or legal entity, you indicate that you have the legal authority to accept these Terms on the other party's behalf, and that any mention of "you" in this contract means the other party that you represent. If you do not have the authority to represent another party, then you do not have permission to use this Game.</p>


<p><strong>The Game</strong></p>

<p>This Game requires that you utilize a Google Chrome or Firefox web browser that currently has a MetaMask browser extension installed. MetaMask is an electronic wallet created by a third party that allows you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You may not use any other electronic wallet on the Game other than MetaMask; however, you can use other electronic wallets and third-party applications to transfer funds to your MetaMask wallet in order to make purchases and receive payment on the Game. If you do not log on to the Game with the correct browser (either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) and/or if the browser does not have the MetaMask extension installed, you will be recognized by the Game, but you will not be able to interact with the Game in any way.</p>

<p>Any and all transactions that take place in the Game occur via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that by using the Game, your Ethereum public address will be made visible to other users of the Game as well as third parties each and every time you engage in a transaction on the Game.</p>

<p>We do not own and we do not control any of the following third-party products used for the function of this Game: MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>We do not own and we do not control any other third-party site, product or service that you may choose to access, visit, or use for the purpose of interacting with or using the Game. We will not be held liable, and are not liable, for the acts or omissions by any such third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held liable, for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using any of the mentioned or unmentioned third parties.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for the safety and security of your MetaMask wallet and/or any other electronic wallet you utilize to interact with the Game.</p>


<p><strong>Fees and Payment</strong></p>

<p>If you choose to make a prediction in the Game, any and all transactions will be conducted through the Ethereum network utilizing a MetaMask electronic wallet. We will not have any insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor will we be able to reverse any transaction that occurs. Because of this, we will have no liability to you or any other third party for any claims or damages that may occur due to any transaction that takes place on the Game and/or in regards to any of the Cities that we have created.</p>

<p>The Ethereum network requires that you pay a transaction fee, commonly known as “Gas”, for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. Gas is intended to fund the hardware and software that runs the Ethereum network, as well as to prevent misuse and spam. If you choose to interact with the Game via our Site or without using the Game or our Site as a portal, you will still need to pay fee for any and every transaction you make on the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>We charge a 5% fee on every prediction made in our Game in addition to the Gas charged by the Ethereum network. By using our Site and our Game, and by making a prediction, you acknowledge this and agree that the fee will be transferred directly to us through the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>You are solely and unequivocally responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added, and other taxes, as well as any duties and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any government authority associated with your use of the Game. This includes, but is not limited to, any taxes, duties, and/or assessments that you become responsible for by making a prediction. Excluding income taxes levied on CryptoPredictions, by using this Game you agree to pay or reimburse us for all taxes and assessments in any jurisdiction with the authority to levy said taxes and assessments. This includes value-added taxes, taxes required by international trade treaties, import or export taxes, and any amounts levied based on charges set, services performed, or transactions made. You are not now or ever entitled to deduct the amount of any taxes, duties, or assessments levied from payments that you have made to us, including the fee collected when you complete a transaction on our Game.</p>


<p><strong>Collecting Winnings</strong></p>

<p>When a prediction is won, you’re responsible for coming back to the Game and collecting your winnings. If you don’t collect your winnings within 30 days of winning, you forfeit them to the Game.</p>
